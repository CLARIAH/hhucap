## Quantitative approach to social mobility
* usually only 2-3 observations over the life course
* limited to observations, not behaviour

## Qualitative approach to social mobility
* limited number of research persons
* generally biased towards more elitish backgrounds

## Combining Qual and Quant
* take all biographies from [biography.net](http://www.biographynet.nl)
* retrieve occupational mentions from biographies
* reconstruct careers

## How - text wizardry
- resource specific text characteristics: order, 
-- e.g. first parental or own description
- chronological information: time derived from recorded event

## How - social mobility part
* code all occupations into a standard
* apply scale scores 

## An example: Johanna Westerdijk
